This may include taking corrective measures, such as suspending or terminating the account of any End-User found to be in violation of the terms of this Agreement.</p>

                        <h3>Generally</h3>
                        <p>“Input” means information, data, and other content, in any form or medium, that is downloaded, or otherwise received, directly or indirectly (including via a third-party provider), from Customer (including from a Permitted User on Customer’s behalf) or any End User by or through the Deep Statistics Services, or provided by Customer to Deep Statistics to input into the Deep Statistics Services. As between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all Input uploaded by the Customer or any End User. Customer represents and warrants to Deep Statistics that Customer has sufficient rights in the Input and has obtain all required consents to grant the rights granted to Deep Statistics in Section 3.2 below and that the Input to the Customer’s knowledge does not infringe or otherwise violate the rights of any third party.</p>

                        <h3>Rights in Input</h3>
                        <p>As between the parties, Customer shall retain all right, title and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) in and to the Input. Customer hereby grants to Deep Statistics a non-exclusive, worldwide, revocable (upon reasonable advance written notice), transferable (as set forth in Section 14.1) fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license to use, copy store, transmit, modify, and display the Input in order to: (a) provide the Deep Statistics Services to Customer; and (b) perform such other actions as authorized or instructed by Customer in writing (email to suffice).</p>

                        <h3>De-identified Data and Data Retention</h3>
                        <p>Deep Statistics may create and use de-identified data related to Customer’s use of the Deep Statistics Services to improve Deep Statistics’s products and services, to develop new products and services, and for its other business purposes (and such de-identified data will be owned by Deep Statistics). For clarity, subject to Section 3.2(a), Deep Statistics shall not use any Inputs or Outputs for any of its internal AI or other training purposes (such as training its machine learning models), including developing new products or services based on Inputs and Outputs, unless agreed otherwise in writing by Customer and Deep Statistics. All Inputs and Outputs are automatically deleted within 30 days, unless (a) otherwise agreed in an Order Form, (b) Deep Statistics is legally required to retain them, or (c) they are flagged as potentially violating this Agreement or the AUP.</p>

                        <h3>Output</h3>
                        <p>As between Customer and Deep Statistics, Customer owns the output of the Deep Statistics Services provided to Customer based on Input (“Output”). Customer shall not represent that Output was human-generated or use the Output to train Customer’s or its providers’ machine learning models. Due to the nature of machine learning, the Output may not be unique across users and the Deep Statistics Service may generate the same or similar Output for other users. Use of the Deep Statistics Service may result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect reality. Customer must evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for Customer’s use case, including by using human review of the Output. Customer understands and agrees that the Output may contain “hallucinations” and may be inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate, or otherwise unsuited to Customer’s purpose, and Customer agrees that Deep Statistics shall not be liable for any damages Customer or any third party alleges to incur as a result of or relating to any Output or other content generated by or accessed on or through the Deep Statistics Service. If Customer shares Input or Output from the Deep Statistics Service with others, Customer authorizes Deep Statistics to share those materials with the applicable third party. Customer is responsible for complying with relevant third-party policies when it instructs Deep Statistics to transmit output to those third parties.</p>

                        <p>Customer may be able to access and use certain optional third-party services or products (e.g., a third-party service that integrates with Deep Statistics via opt-in, or uses Deep Statistics’s APIs) through or with its use of the Deep Statistics Services (“Third-Party Services”). Customer is under no obligation to use any Third-Party Services. Additionally, all or some portions of the Deep Statistics Services may be subject to additional and/or separate terms and conditions, including but not limited to open-source software licenses and other third-party software license terms and conditions (“Third-Party Terms”).

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, ALL THIRD-PARTY SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. IF CUSTOMER USES ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, Deep Statistics WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY PROVIDER OF SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICES. Deep Statistics DOES NOT WARRANT OR PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICES. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT Deep Statistics WILL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY PERMITTED USERS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.</p>

                        <h3>Feedback</h3>

                        <h2>LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER</h2>

                        <p>Each party represents and warrants to the other that it has the full right and power to enter into and perform under this Agreement, without any third party consents or conflicts with any other agreement. Deep Statistics warrants that it will provide the Deep Statistics Services in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation and the descriptions in the Order Form. Deep Statistics’s sole liability (and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty shall be, in Deep Statistics’s sole discretion and at no charge to Customer, to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with an error correction or work-around that corrects the reported non-conformity, or if Deep Statistics determines such remedies to be impracticable, to allow Customer to terminate the Subscription Term and receive as its sole and exclusive remedy and Deep Statistics’s entire liability, a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the Deep Statistics Services or related services it has not received as of the date of the warranty claim.

                        <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
                        <p>NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE, UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY OF LAW, WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, CONTRACTS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, PRODUCTION, AND ANTICIPATED SAVINGS OR DATA, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO Deep Statistics DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO WHEN THE CLAIM AROSE.</p>

                        <h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>

                        <h3>Indemnification by Deep Statistics</h3>
                        <p>Deep Statistics shall indemnify and defend Customer from and against any claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising from infringement of patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right asserted against Customer by a third party based upon Customer’s use of the Deep Statistics Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided that Deep Statistics shall have received from Customer: (a) prompt written notice of such claim; (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement (if applicable) of such claim (as long as such settlement releases Customer from any and all liability); and (c) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer at Deep Statistics’s expense. In addition, Customer may, at its own cost and expense, appoint its own counsel with respect to defense of the claim; and any settlement that does not provide for a full and unconditional release of Customer shall require Customer’s consent. If Customer’s use of any Deep Statistics Service is, or in Deep Statistics’s opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the type of infringement specified above, or if required by settlement, Deep Statistics may, in its sole and reasonable discretion: (x) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services; (y) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Deep Statistics Services; or if (x) and (y) are commercially impracticable, (z) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer any unused, prepaid fees paid by Customer for the terminated period. The foregoing indemnification obligation of Deep Statistics shall not apply to the extent that the alleged infringement arises from: (1) any modification of the Deep Statistics Services other than by or on behalf of Deep Statistics; (2) access to or use of any Deep Statistics Service in combination with any hardware, system, software, network, or other products, materials or services not provided by or on behalf of Deep Statistics, including the Bundled Services; (3) use of the Deep Statistics Services in breach of this Agreement; or (4) Input. THIS SECTION 9.1 SETS FORTH Deep Statistics’S SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.</p>

                        <h3>Indemnification by Customer</h3>

This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving: (x) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice); (y) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim (any settlement, subject to Deep Statistics’s prior written consent); and (z) all reasonably necessary cooperation of Deep Statistics at Customer’s expense.</p>

                        <h2>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h2>

                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>“Confidential Information” means information disclosed by one party to the other that is marked as confidential or proprietary or that ought reasonably to be understood as confidential or proprietary. All Deep Statistics Technology, performance information relating to the Deep Statistics Services, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the fees and pricing information) shall be deemed Confidential Information of Deep Statistics without any marking or further designation. Customer’s Confidential Information includes Input and Output (subject to Section 3.4). Confidential Information does not include information that the recipient already lawfully knew, that becomes public through no fault of the recipient, that was independently developed by the recipient without any reference to or use of Confidential Information, or that was rightfully obtained by the recipient from a third party.</p>

                        <h3>Obligations</h3>
                        <p>The recipient agrees not to disclose Confidential Information except to its Affiliates, employees, contractors and agents who need to know it and have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. Only those parties may use the Confidential Information, and only to exercise the recipient’s rights and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, while using at least a reasonable degree of care to protect it. The recipient may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law after providing reasonable notice to the discloser and cooperating to obtain confidential treatment. Unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information may cause harm not compensable by damages, and the disclosing party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, without posting a bond, to protect its Confidential Information.</p>

                        <h2>PRIVACY; SECURITY</h2>

                        <h3>Privacy</h3>
                        <p>By using the Deep Statistics Services, you acknowledge that we may collect, use, and disclose your personal information and information relating to individuals associated with your account, including Feedback, as set forth in our Privacy Policy located at <a href="https://deep.statistics.org.in/legal/privacy-policy">https://deep.statistics.org.in/legal/privacy-policy</a>, as it may be updated from time to time. Your use of the Deep Statistics Services and your Input and Output shall always comply with your privacy policies and all applicable local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and conventions, including, without limitation, those related to data privacy, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal information (including “personal data” as defined under applicable data protection laws). “Personal Data” means any information defined as “personal information” under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (“CCPA”), “personal data” under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) or other similar terms under applicable data privacy and security laws, regulations, or other legal requirements.

Section 160.103), unless you signed a Business Associate Agreement with us in advance.</p>

                        <h3>Security</h3>
                        <p>Deep Statistics shall use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative procedures designed to protect, safeguard and help prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Input, which will meet at least the minimum requirements set forth in the DPA, and Deep Statistics will reasonably choose these safeguards in line with industry standards and based on the sensitivity of the information that is collected, processed, and stored and the current state of applicable technology.</p>

                        <h2>PUBLICITY</h2>
                        <p>Except as otherwise agreed in writing (email to suffice), neither party may use the other party’s name, logos, or marks without such party’s written pre-approval in each case.</p>

                        <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

                        <h3>Arbitration</h3>

                        <h4>General</h4>
                        <p>THIS SECTION REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH CUSTOMER CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM Deep Statistics. This Arbitration requirement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between Customer and Deep Statistics that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly, this Agreement and/or Customer’s access to or use of the Deep Statistics Services, including, without limitation, Customer’s receipt of any advertising or marketing communications (each, a “Claim,” and collectively, “Claims”). This Section 13.1 will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after execution of this Agreement.</p>

                        <h4>Dispute Resolution Process</h4>
                        <p>For any Claim, Customer will first contact Deep Statistics at <a href="mailto:legal@statistics.org.in">legal@statistics.org.in</a> and meet and confer to attempt to resolve the Claim with Deep Statistics informally. In the event that Deep Statistics has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, both parties agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. AAA may be contacted at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Section 13.1, this Section 13.1 will control. The arbitration will be conducted in Tarrant County, Texas, unless Customer and Deep Statistics agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Customer and Deep Statistics agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Section 13.1, including any claim that all or any part of this Section 13.1 is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether this Agreement are, or whether any provision of this Agreement is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.</p>

                        <h4>Equitable Relief</h4>
                        <p>NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 13.1 WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING EITHER PARTY FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF CUSTOMER’S OR Deep Statistics’S DATA SECURITY, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING CUSTOMER FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT, PROVIDED THAT CUSTOMER’S CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.</p>

                        <h4>Severability</h4>
                        <p>If this Section 13.1 is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Section 13.1, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 13.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent Customer from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Section 13.1 will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>

                        <h4>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h4>
                        <p>BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER AND Deep Statistics ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS Deep Statistics AGREES OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. CUSTOMER AND Deep Statistics AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON CUSTOMER’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</p>

                        <h2>GENERAL TERMS</h2>

No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived. Purchase orders (and similar documents) issued by Customer are for administrative purposes only (e.g. setting forth products and services ordered and associated fees) and any additional or different terms or conditions contained in any such order shall not apply (even if the order is accepted, or performed on by Deep Statistics).</p>

                        <h2>What are cookies and local storage?</h2>
